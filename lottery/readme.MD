# Lottery - Solidity contract

A very simple contract, which allows different users to buy lottery tickets for a single draw.

Each ticket purchased increases the jackpot, so the winner takes all.

## For the future

add a state variable, that says if the lottery is open or closed to buy tickets. And that the draws have a time frame.
